            "Muhammad Ali was one of the greatest human beings I have ever met.
            No doubt he was one of the best people to have lived in this day and
            age." -

            "His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public
            standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make
            him reviled, and nearly send him to jail. But Ali stood his ground.
            And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize
            today." - <span>US President Barack Obama</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            "Today we bow our heads at the loss of a man who did so much for
            America. Tomorrow we will raise our heads again remembering that his
            bravery, his outspokenness, and his sacrifice for the sake of his
            community and country lives on in the best part of each of us.
            <br />

            "At a time when blacks who spoke up about injustice were labelled
            uppity and often arrested under one pretext or another, Muhammad
            willingly sacrificed the best years of his career to stand tall and
            fight for what he believed was right. In doing so, he made all
            Americans, black and white, stand taller. I may be 7ft 2in but I
            never felt taller than when standing in his shadow." -
            <span>former basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            "There will never be another Muhammad Ali. The black community all
            around the world, black people all around the world, needed him. He
            was the voice for us. He's the voice for me to be where I'm at
            today." -

          <p>
            "Everybody wanted to box because of him. He was just so amazing in
            every way. More than anything else it was how humble and how
            brilliantly charismatic he was. He was a beautiful-looking man, a
            beautiful-looking individual and he had so much compassion. He was
            the greatest sportsman there has ever been and we were very lucky
            that he chose boxing." -

            "Hillary and I are saddened by the passing of Muhammad Ali. From the
            day he claimed the Olympic gold medal in 1960, boxing fans across
            the world knew they were seeing a blend of beauty and grace, speed
            and strength that may never be matched again. "We watched him grow
            from the brash self-confidence of youth and success into a manhood
            full of religious and political convictions that led him to make
            tough choices and live with the consequences. "Along the way we saw
            him courageous in the ring, inspiring to the young, compassionate to
            those in need, and strong and good-humoured in bearing the burden of
            his own health challenges."-
