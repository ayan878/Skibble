  <p>"Muhammad Ali was one of the greatest human beings I have ever met. No doubt he was one of the best people to have lived in this day and age." - <span>George Foreman, Ali's friend and rival in the Rumble in the Jungle</span> </p>

  <p>"His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail. But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today." - <span>US President Barack Obama</span></p>

  <p>"Today we bow our heads at the loss of a man who did so much for America. Tomorrow we will raise our heads again remembering that his bravery, his outspokenness, and his sacrifice for the sake of his community and country lives on in the best part of each of us. <br>

"At a time when blacks who spoke up about injustice were labelled uppity and often arrested under one pretext or another, Muhammad willingly sacrificed the best years of his career to stand tall and fight for what he believed was right. In doing so, he made all Americans, black and white, stand taller. I may be 7ft 2in but I never felt taller than when standing in his shadow." - <span>former basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</span></p>

<p>"There will never be another Muhammad Ali. The black community all around the world, black people all around the world, needed him. He was the voice for us. He's the voice for me to be where I'm at today." - <span>Floyd Mayweather, world champion boxer across five divisions</span> </p>

<p>"Everybody wanted to box because of him. He was just so amazing in every way. More than anything else it was how humble and how brilliantly charismatic he was. He was a beautiful-looking man, a beautiful-looking individual and he had so much compassion. He was the greatest sportsman there has ever been and we were very lucky that he chose boxing." - <span>Barry McGuigan, former world featherweight champion</span></p>

<p>"You were a champion in so many ways. You 'fought' well. Rest well." - <span>Bernice King, daughter of civil rights leader Martin Luther King</span></p>
